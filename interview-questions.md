# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: it is taking whatever is in the this.state and taking it out of this.state so it can be called by itself so you don't have to type this.state numerous times.

  Researched answer
  It allows us to extract properties from an object or items from an array, multiple at a time

  Your answer: I would google .map w3schools, but i believe it relates to arrays, so arrays of numbers, strings and not sure about the third.

4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: I would do more research on this question, but div has to do with a tag so i'd say they're related somehow.

  Researched answer:
  The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: it is <></> and would be used to contain the return because a div can sometimes cause issues in tables and etc...

  Researched answer:
  You can use fragments to create components that return a list of elements without wrapping them in a container or array. This is useful for components that return form and text markup â€” as wrapping the result in a container <div> can cause headaches when styling things
